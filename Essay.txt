FLAW 1:

The first flaw is A03 (SQL) injection. In the server code, the username and password hash are concatenated without parametrization and the text from the user textbox is directly sent to the database. This makes SQL injection possible and the user can login with any selected username, bypassing the password completely.

The fix is included in the code: comment out the block starting "Injection begins!" and ending "injection ends! Corrected code follows:" and uncomment the code after that.

FLAW 2:

The second flaw is A02 Cryptographic failures. In the original code, passwords are stored unsaltes, hashed with a single SHA256 iteration. SHA256 is a very fast algorithm, making it possible to try different passwords fast in succession. If the attacker gets access to the database, the unsalted hashes make it possible to use rainbow attacks and recognize same hashes attached to usernames in different systems. In the fixed version, a salt is used and SHA256 is iterated 200 000 times, making it more expensive time-wise to calculate.
